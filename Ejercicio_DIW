-What site is this? (Is it clear enough?)
	
	It is a place where they sell different products, where we can find computer products, 		merchandising of office objects such as mugs, etc..
	

-Does it follow conventions?
        Menus, logos, content,…
	
		Yes.

        Are elements clear enough? (Search inputs, icons, social networks,…)

		Yes, and they are also well distributed by the page.	

-Is the hierarchy evident (sections, subsections,…)? Can I see the major sections of the site? What options do I have at this level of the hierarchy?

	Yes, because the menu is very intuitive when changing sections and entering subsections.

-Are the pages divided in well defined sections / layers?

	Yes.

-Can you distinguish links and buttons?

	if because the links contain a "title" that represents them and the buttons are clear.

-Is there any content that distracts the user?

	Not since the site is 100% dedicated to the purchase of their products, and has its own 	ads, which are related to what they are selling.

-Is the content structured?

	Yes by sections and by content blocks.


-Are there any search options? Are they clear enough?

	Yes, one looks good but there is another that is much more difficult to differentiate, as 	it does not look good.
